# power-prices

A very hacky script to compare power prices based on actual usage. Input is a path to a CSV file in [Electricity Authority EIEP13A](https://www.ea.govt.nz/assets/dms-assets/30/EIEP13A-HHR-and-NHH-combined-v1.4.pdf) format.

Everything's hardcoded, you'll need to find your own companies/prices and update the script.
